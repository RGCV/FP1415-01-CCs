### Problem Description

Credit card numbers share a common numbering scheme according to ISO / IEC 7812.
The most used scheme for credit card numbers ranges from 12 to 19 digits with a
certain form.

Briefly, a credit card number's first digit represents the category of the
issuing entity, the first six digits (a.k.a. IIN, Issuer Identification Number)
identify the institution, leaving the rest to the issuer's criteria. Most credit
card numbers are validated using Luhn's algorithm.

With this project, it is inteded that a program is written in `Python` that
performs two kinds of operations: (1) verify the correction of a credit card
number, and (2) generate correct credit card numbers.
